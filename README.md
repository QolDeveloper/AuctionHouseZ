# Overview
This is a Forge 1.8.9 mod that snipes items with a margin on the Hypixel Skyblock Auction House, so you can sell them for profit

# How does it work?
It works by using the Auction House API to find items with a high sell rate and large margins. Example: Someone lists a JuJu Shortbow for 1.3m, the next lowest bin is 13m, JuJu Shortbows also have a lot of sales per day, the mod will send a message in chat for you to click which will open up the auction for that JuJu Shortbow, you can proceed to buy it and list it for 13m!

# Why is this useful?
It is useful if you are looking to make money on Hypixel Skyblock!

# Auction House Z Download
You install AuctionHouseZ just like you install any other Forge 1.8.9 mod, download and put it in your mods folder!
 
 IMPORTANT: AuctionHouseZ may conflict with Skytils, NEU and or SBE because they all are trying to use the same API. USING THIS MOD ON FEATHER CLIENT MAY RESULT IN GAME CRASHES/THE MOD NOT WORKING.
